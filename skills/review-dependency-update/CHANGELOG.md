## 1.1.0 — The Atomic Splitter (2026-03-31)

Adds Phase 1b: automatic commit splitting for PRs that bundle multiple unrelated
dependency bumps into a single commit. Runs before investigation so the review
proceeds against a clean, bisectable history.

- New `p1b-split-commits.md` phase — Ink (Commit Curator) inspects PR commits,
  identifies bundles, plans the split, soft-resets and re-commits by logical group,
  then force-pushes with `--force-with-lease`
- Grouping heuristics: same npm scope / Maven groupId / PyPI namespace, coordinated
  releases (react + react-dom, boto3 + botocore), and shared BOM entries stay together
- Skips automatically if all bump commits are already atomic
- Orchestrator flow and dispatch table updated; Ink persona now declared for both
  Phase 1b and Phase 4

## 1.0.0 — The First Pass (2026-03-30)

Initial release of the dependency-update review skill. Six-phase pipeline covering
PR parsing, changelog investigation, code-impact mapping, remediation, risk verdict,
and PR comment posting. Integrates Echo, Rook, Kira, and Arden personas.

- Phase 1: normalise PR reference (number, hash, or URL) and extract dependency metadata
- Phase 2: changelog and API-change investigation with Echo; security red-team with Rook
- Phase 3: codebase impact mapping — usages of changed or deprecated APIs
- Phase 4: conditional remediation with Kira — atomic commits per fix
- Phase 5: risk verdict with Arden — Low / Medium / High / Critical classification
- Phase 6: post structured verdict as a GitHub PR comment
