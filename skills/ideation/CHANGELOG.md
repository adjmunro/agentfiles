## 1.0.0 — The First Draft (2026-03-22)

The ideation skill launches with a seamless 9-step loop that collapses capture, research, interview, planning, and ticket creation into one continuous workflow. Users capture ideas, get intelligent recommendations informed by codebase research, build plans collaboratively, and exit with a ready-to-work backlog — all without breaking context.

- Thin `ideate.md` orchestrator drives the full 9-step workflow
- Step 1: Capture verbatim input and assets into `00-input-{subject}.md`
- Step 2: Research phase scans local files and documentation before interviewing
- Step 3: Interview phase asks research-informed questions with recommendations and tradeoff explanations
- Steps 4–5: Plan drafting and critic audit gate with 95% threshold
- Step 6: Validation loop — continue, add more, or abandon
- Steps 7–8: Ticket creation in `03-refinement/` with critic audit gate
- Step 9: Hard-stop decision: add tickets to backlog (`04-todo/`) or abandon with explicit slug confirmation
- New directory structure: `YYYY-MM-DD-{subject}/` with stages `03-refinement/` through `08-done/`
- Personas shared from `skills/kanban/personas/` — no duplication
- Independent versioning starting at v1.0.0, separate from kanban skill
